1. For the outer loop count the number of rows
2. For the inner loop, focus on the columns and connect them somehow to the rows
3. print the * inside the inner for loop
4. Observe symmetry in the pattern or check if a pattern is a combination of two or more similar patterns or not. [optional step]. not required for every pattern design
